## üîÑ **How It Works - Step by Step**

### **Phase 1: Election Setup**
1. **Election Creation**: Administrator deploys smart contract with election parameters
2. **Candidate Registration**: Eligible candidates are added with their details
3. **Voter Registration**: Eligible voters register their wallet addresses
4. **Parameter Configuration**: Set voting duration, rules, and requirements

### **Phase 2: Voting Process**
1. **Election Activation**: Smart contract automatically opens voting at scheduled time
2. **Voter Authentication**: Voters connect their wallets and verify eligibility
3. **Vote Casting**: Voters select candidates and submit encrypted votes
4. **Vote Recording**: Votes are permanently recorded on blockchain
5. **Real-time Counting**: Vote tallies update automatically

### **Phase 3: Results & Verification**
1. **Automatic Closure**: Voting ends at predetermined time
2. **Result Calculation**: Smart contract calculates winners algorithmically
3. **Winner Declaration**: Results are published transparently
4. **Audit Trail**: Complete voting history remains accessible forever
